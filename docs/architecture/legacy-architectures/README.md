# 📁 Legacy Architecture Diagrams

## ⚠️ **Archived Diagrams**

This directory contains previous versions of architecture diagrams that have been superseded by the latest designs. These are kept for historical reference and comparison purposes.

## 🎯 **Why These Were Archived**

### **Superseded by Latest Designs**
The current architecture (v3.0) focuses on:
- **Strands Agents Integration**: Advanced multi-agent orchestration
- **Full-Stack Architecture**: Complete S3 + CloudFront frontend
- **Simplified Presentation**: Clean, focused diagrams for stakeholders

### **Evolution Timeline**
- **v1.x**: Basic single-agent architecture
- **v2.x**: Multi-agent system with basic coordination
- **v3.0**: Strands-enhanced with full-stack frontend (Current)

## 📋 **When to Use Legacy Diagrams**

### **✅ Appropriate Use Cases**
- Historical reference and comparison
- Understanding system evolution
- Detailed component analysis
- Academic or research purposes

### **❌ Not Recommended For**
- New presentations or documentation
- Current system implementation
- Stakeholder communications
- Production planning

## 🔄 **Migration to Current Architecture**

If you need specific details from legacy diagrams:

1. **Review Current Diagrams**: Check if information exists in v3.0
2. **Consult Architecture Guide**: See `docs/architecture/README.md`
3. **Custom Diagram**: Edit current .drawio files to add needed details
4. **Technical Documentation**: Refer to detailed technical docs

## 📞 **Support**

For questions about legacy architectures or migration to current designs:
- Review main architecture documentation
- Consult technical team
- Check project evolution history
