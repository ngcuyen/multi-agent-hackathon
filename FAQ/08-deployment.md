# ðŸš€ Deployment & Operations FAQ

## **Q1: What is the deployment architecture and strategy?**
**A:** Modern cloud-native deployment:
- **Container Orchestration**: ECS Fargate for serverless containers
- **Multi-AZ Deployment**: Services distributed across availability zones
- **Blue-Green Deployments**: Zero-downtime releases with automatic rollback
- **Infrastructure as Code**: AWS CDK for reproducible deployments
- **Environment Parity**: Identical dev/staging/production configurations
- **Automated Scaling**: Dynamic resource allocation based on demand

## **Q2: How do you ensure zero-downtime deployments?**
**A:** Continuous deployment strategy:
- **Blue-Green Strategy**: New version deployed alongside current version
- **Health Checks**: Automated validation before traffic switching
- **Gradual Traffic Shifting**: Progressive rollout with monitoring
- **Automatic Rollback**: Immediate reversion if issues detected
- **Database Migrations**: Backward-compatible schema changes
- **Service Mesh**: Intelligent traffic routing during deployments

## **Q3: What CI/CD pipeline is implemented?**
**A:** Comprehensive automation pipeline:
- **Source Control**: Git with feature branch workflow
- **Build Stage**: AWS CodeBuild with Docker multi-stage builds
- **Testing Stage**: Automated unit, integration, and security tests
- **Staging Deployment**: Automatic deployment to staging environment
- **Production Deployment**: Approved deployment with monitoring
- **Post-deployment**: Automated verification and health checks

## **Q4: How do you manage different environments (dev/staging/production)?**
**A:** Environment management strategy:
- **Environment Isolation**: Separate AWS accounts for each environment
- **Configuration Management**: Environment-specific parameters
- **Data Isolation**: Separate databases and storage per environment
- **Access Controls**: Environment-specific IAM roles and permissions
- **Monitoring**: Environment-specific dashboards and alerts
- **Cost Allocation**: Separate billing and cost tracking

## **Q5: What monitoring and observability tools are deployed?**
**A:** Comprehensive observability stack:
- **Application Monitoring**: CloudWatch with custom metrics
- **Infrastructure Monitoring**: AWS Systems Manager and CloudWatch
- **Log Aggregation**: Centralized logging with structured data
- **Distributed Tracing**: AWS X-Ray for request flow tracking
- **Alerting**: SNS notifications with escalation procedures
- **Dashboards**: Real-time visualization of system health

## **Q6: How do you handle configuration management and secrets?**
**A:** Secure configuration practices:
- **AWS Systems Manager**: Parameter Store for configuration
- **AWS Secrets Manager**: Secure storage of sensitive data
- **Environment Variables**: Container-level configuration
- **Configuration Validation**: Startup checks for required parameters
- **Secret Rotation**: Automatic rotation of credentials
- **Audit Logging**: All configuration changes tracked

## **Q7: What backup and disaster recovery procedures are in place?**
**A:** Comprehensive data protection:
- **Automated Backups**: Daily snapshots with 30-day retention
- **Cross-Region Replication**: Data replicated to Tokyo region
- **Point-in-Time Recovery**: Database recovery to any point in time
- **Infrastructure Recreation**: Complete environment rebuild capability
- **Disaster Recovery Testing**: Monthly DR drills and validation
- **RTO/RPO Targets**: 4-hour Recovery Time, 1-hour Recovery Point

## **Q8: How do you manage costs and optimize resource usage?**
**A:** Cost optimization strategies:
- **Right-sizing**: Continuous analysis of resource utilization
- **Auto-scaling**: Scale resources based on actual demand
- **Reserved Instances**: 40-60% savings for predictable workloads
- **Spot Instances**: 30-50% savings for fault-tolerant workloads
- **Storage Optimization**: Intelligent tiering and lifecycle policies
- **Cost Monitoring**: Real-time cost tracking and budget alerts
