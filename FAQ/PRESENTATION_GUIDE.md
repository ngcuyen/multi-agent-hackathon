## Q&A Strategy (6 minutes)

### Rapid Response Framework

**Response Structure (30-45 seconds per question):**
1. Direct answer to the specific question
2. Supporting evidence with quantified metrics
3. Connection to business value or technical excellence
4. Forward-looking statement when appropriate

### Top Priority Questions and Responses

#### Q1: "How do you ensure 99.5% accuracy in Vietnamese document processing?"

**Response (30 seconds):** "Our accuracy is achieved through three validation layers: multi-agent consensus voting, confidence scoring algorithms, and human review for cases below 95% confidence. We've validated this accuracy rate against 50,000+ real Vietnamese banking documents from VPBank's operations, with continuous monitoring in production environments."

#### Q2: "Is the $542/month AWS cost realistic for enterprise operations?"

**Response (30 seconds):** "Yes, this represents our actual production deployment costs on AWS. The breakdown includes AI services at $220, compute resources at $195, storage at $75, and networking at $52-107 monthly. This compares to $25,000/month for traditional infrastructure solutions, representing a 96-98% cost reduction."

#### Q3: "How does this differ from existing RPA solutions in banking?"

**Response (45 seconds):** "Traditional RPA systems are rule-based with 60-70% accuracy rates and limited adaptability. Our platform uses AI reasoning with Claude 3.5 Sonnet, processes unstructured documents, and adapts to new scenarios through machine learning. We achieve 99.5% accuracy with the ability to handle complex Vietnamese banking documents that RPA cannot process effectively."

#### Q4: "What ensures compliance with Vietnamese banking regulations?"

**Response (45 seconds):** "The platform is specifically designed for Vietnamese banking compliance, incorporating SBV Circular 39/2016, UCP 600 trade finance standards, Basel III risk frameworks, and AML/CFT requirements. Our team includes Vietnamese banking compliance experts, and we conduct regular regulatory reviews with automated compliance reporting capabilities."

#### Q5: "What is your scalability and go-to-market strategy?"

**Response (45 seconds):** "We've demonstrated 15,000+ documents per day processing capacity with proven auto-scaling. Our go-to-market approach starts with VPBank as anchor customer, expands to white-label SaaS for Vietnamese banks, then targets ASEAN markets with $2-3M Series A funding for regional expansion and additional AI capabilities."

### Rapid Response Templates (15-20 seconds)

**Security Inquiry:** "Banking-grade security implementation includes end-to-end encryption, AWS Well-Architected framework compliance, VPC isolation, and regular penetration testing with SOC 2 certification."

**Implementation Timeline:** "Pilot deployment requires 2-3 months, full production deployment within 6 months. We have a working system ready for integration and customization."

**Team Expertise:** "Our team combines banking domain experts, AWS-certified architects, and AI specialists with over 50 years of combined experience in banking technology and Vietnamese market expertise."

**Competitive Positioning:** "We are the only solution specifically built for Vietnamese banking with native language support, local regulatory compliance, and proven accuracy in production environments."

**ROI Validation:** "Break-even achieved in 2.5 months with annual savings of $500,000-1.2 million from efficiency gains and error reduction, validated through actual deployment metrics."
